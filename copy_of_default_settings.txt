## Group-specific settings:
# groupID: Group's identifier. Used as the prefix of host names
# nrofHosts: number of hosts in the group
# movementModel: movement model of the hosts (valid class name from movement package)
# speed: minimum and maximum speeds (m/s) when moving on a path
# waitTime: minimum and maximum wait times (seconds) after reaching destination
# router: router used to route messages (valid class name from routing package)
# bufferSize: size of the message buffer (bytes)
# msgTTL: TTL (minutes) of the messages created by this host group, default=infinite
# routerRndSeed: the seed for the random number generator that determines the routing choices
#                 according to the chosen dissemination strategy
# activeTimes: Time intervals when the nodes in the group are active (start1, end1, start2, end2, ...)
# deleteDelivered: if true and the final recipient of a message rejects it because the node had
#                  already received the message, that message gets deleted from the buffer; default=false
# messagePriorityStrategy: accepatble values range from 0 to 3:
#               0 - random queue - default
#               1 - FIFO queue
#               2 - Prioritized FIFO queue (higher priority messages first)
#               3 - Prioritized LFF FIFO queue (Least Forwarded, higher prioriy, older messages First)
# messageForwardingOrderManager: accepatble values range from 0 to 1:
#               0 - FIFO Forwarding Manager - default
#               1 - Exponentially Decaying Probability (EDP) Forwarding Manager
# subDisMode: defines how subscriptions affect the dissemination strategy:
#               0 - strict (non-porous channels)
#               1 - semiPorous (semi-porous channels)
#               2 - flexible (subscriptions do not affect the dissemination strategy) - default
# subIDRndSeed: the seed for the random number generator that generates subscriptions for each node.
# minNrofSubscriptions: minimum number of subscriptions for which a node randomly signs up
# maxNrofSubscriptions: maximum number of subscriptions for which a node randomly signs up
# maxSubID: the highest ID allowed for a subscription
# subIDs: it specifies a comma-separated list of the subscription IDs the nodes of a group will subscribe to;
#         if subIDs is specified, any entry for maxSize is ignored (in every group if subIDs is specified
#         at the global level); a value of "-1" resets the global defaults specified for subIDs to read
#         the value of maxSize.
# msgDissProbability: message dissemination probability - the probability of forwarding a message even if no
#                    neighbours belong to the same subscription of the message.
# msgAcceptProbability: message acceptance probability - the probability of storing a received message even if
#                      if the recipient node does not belong to the message subscription
#
